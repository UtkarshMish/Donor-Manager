# Donor Management

#### A Donation Management Fundraising website mini project

## Introduction
Mini project for BE Information Science & Engineering on PHP and MySQL.

## Requirement
1.) This library package requires PHP 5.3 or later.
Before PHP 5.3.7, pcre.backtrack_limit defaults to 100 000, which is too small in many situations. You might need to set it to higher values. Later PHP releases defaults to 1 000 000, which is usually fine.

2.) XAMPP 7.1.1
